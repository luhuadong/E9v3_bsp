$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdx
Type the following parameters (each followed by <ENTER>):
    p [lists the current partitions]
    d [to delete existing partitions. Repeat this until no unnecessary partitions are reported by the 'p' command to start fresh.]
    n [create a new partition]
    p [create a primary partition - use for both partitions]
    1 [the first partition]
    20480 [starting at offset sector]
    1024000 [size for the first partition to be used for the boot images]
    p [to check the partitions]
    
    n
    p
    2
    1228800 [starting at offset sector, which leaves enough space for the kernel,the bootloader and its configuration data]
    <enter> [using the default value will create a partition that extends to the last sector of the media]
    p       [to check the partitions]
    w       [this writes the partition table to the media and fdisk exits]
